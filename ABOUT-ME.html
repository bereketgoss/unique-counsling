Hello, i'm Bereket Gossaye. i'm freshman undergraduate student.
i attended computer programming course as a second semester freshman
course and i gained a large exposure about how to design a website using
visual studio code and effective use of UI/UX which help me to design this website.
I heard many students say 'I do not know what to study in college or university.
'which was also the problem of mine. when i entered university i didn't know which 
field to study. but when i talk to senior students from different fields and told me
about their field in detail i was able to decide which field to study. i designed this
website for students especially for freshman students who need assistance about which 
field to study in accordance to their interest and skill and providing them a chance
to discover about fields through communicating with their seniors. we planned to launch
webminar and online counseling in which students can reach regardless of wherever they are.
